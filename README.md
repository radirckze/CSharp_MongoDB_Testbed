# VSC MongoDB Tutorial
My Visual Studio Code Mongo DB tutorial and test project. 
View at your own risk!

Note: this is a testbed to test MongoDB stuff in isoloation. (WebAPI is where
I test a a scenario for a similar real-world project.)

This project was created to test two things:
1. Invoking a MapReduce function from c# (Crimes example)
2. Using the normalized data model  with document references (uses Members and Items).
