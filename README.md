# VSC MongoDB Tutorial
My Visual Studio Code MongoDB tutorial and test project. 

View at your own risk!

Note: this is a testbed to test MongoDB stuff in isolation. (WebAPI project is where
I plan to test a scenario similar to a real-world project.)

This project was created to test two things:
1. Invoking a MapReduce function from c# (Crimes example)
2. Using the normalized data model with document references (uses Members and Items).
